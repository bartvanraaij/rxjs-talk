# Get out of Callback Hell: Observables and RxJS to the rescue

Are you still writing callback functions? Hanging on to the good ol' jQuery days? There's no shame in that, but before you know it you're standing at the gates of Callback Hell. Luckily that can be prevented, and one of the libraries that can rescue you is RxJS. 

Observables and RxJS can help you to write clean and concise code for handling asynchronous stuff: from retrieving data from an API, to reading files from disk and waiting for user interactions. RxJS can be quite hard though: its learning curve is steep, especially if you're unfamiliar with reactive and declarative programming and all of the terminology that comes with it.

But don't worry, in this talk I will guide you through the first steps of using Observables and RxJS in a frameworkless fashion. I'll explain its terminology and talk you through some of the most used operators like switchMap, merge, debounceTime and concatMap in a practical sense. 
We'll go through some common use cases and pitfalls and learn how it all translates back to the patterns you're already familiar with.

After attending I'm sure you'll think twice when trying to write another callback function!
