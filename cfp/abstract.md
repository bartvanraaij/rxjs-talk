# Stepping out of Callback Hell: using Observables and RxJS for your async code.

Are you still writing callback functions? Hanging on to the good ol' jQuery days?
There's no shame in that, but before you know it you're standing at the gates of Callback Hell. Luckily there's this shiny relatively new library that'll help you get out, and it's called RxJS.

Observables and RxJS can help you to write clean and concise code for handling asynchronous stuff: from retrieving data from an API to reading files from disk and waiting for user interactions. RxJS can be quite hard though: its learning curve is steep, especially if you're unfamiliar with reactive and declarative programming and all of the terminology that comes with it. 

In this talk I will guide you through the first steps of using Observables and RxJS. I'll explain its terminology and talk you through some of the most used operators like switchMap, merge and debounce in a practical sense. 
I'll present you with some common use cases and pitfalls and show how it all translates back to the patterns you're more familiar with.

After attending I'm sure you'll think twice when trying to write another callback function!
