This would be my first talk on a large conference. I do have speaking experience from smaller meetups and in-house company trainings.

I have attended iJS MÃ¼nchen a few times. In 2019 I volunteered to give an impromptu presentation in the "Open space" at the Fullstack Day, where I spoke about RxJS too. This was well received by both the organisation and the public.

In due course I have acquainted experienced speakers Hans-Christian Otto and Rowdy Rabouw. Both have agreed to help and mentor me for this speaking gig. I'm very pleased with their help and they both fully support this CFP.
